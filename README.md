# Predicting Fraud in Financial Transactions
This project presents a comprehensive approach to detecting fraudulent financial transactions using Machine Learning and Business Intelligence tools. It combines predictive modeling with an interactive Power BI dashboard to enable real-time monitoring, risk analysis, and decision-making.

# Project Overview
With the rise of digital financial services, fraudulent activities have become increasingly complex and frequent. This project addresses that challenge by analyzing transactional patterns and building a predictive model to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. It also includes a Power BI dashboard to help visualize key fraud indicators and trends for business users.

# Key Features
* Predictive model for detecting fraud in real-time

* In-depth data analysis on transaction types, devices, and payment methods

* Interactive Power BI dashboard with dynamic visuals

* AI-powered analytics such as Key Influencers and Anomaly Detection

* Real-world financial fraud insights with business impact metrics

# Methodology

* Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features, Detect and handle
outliers.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution plots, correlation checks, and trends over time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

* Power BI:

Created an interactive Power BI report for business insights.

# Power BI Dashboard
* The Power BI dashboard titled "Financial Fraud Tracking & Prevention" provides:

* Total transactions, fraud losses, and transaction averages

* Visual breakdown of fraud by payment method and device

* Geographic insights into fraudulent activity

* Interactive charts and filters for deep analysis

* Real-time detection using anomaly detection features

# Key statistics:

* Total Fraud Loss: $7.77 Million

* Fraudulent Transactions Detected: 2,510

* Average Transaction Amount: $2.98K

# Tools & Technologies

* Python for data analysis and model training

* Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

* Power BI Desktop for interactive dashboard development

# Project Outcomes

This project successfully demonstrates how combining machine learning with business intelligence tools can greatly enhance the detection and prevention of financial fraud. It provides organizations with a proactive system to minimize losses, identify suspicious activity quickly, and make data-driven decisions.
